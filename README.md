# Rit

A simple git wrapper to make my life slightly easier.

## Why?

I am tired of spending too much time on git commands. I could have done this with bash aliases, but I want to get better at rust so here we are.

## Install

Install from <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>

`cargo install rit-mazy`
